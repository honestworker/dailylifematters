                        </p>
                        <h3>Third-party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by third-parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our website. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services . They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
                            <br/> <br/> We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers, see How We Use and Disclose Your Information.
                            <br/> <br/> We have contracted with Yahoo to monitor certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting web traffic, statistics, advertisement ‘click-throughs,’ and/or other activities on our website. No personally identifiable data is transferred to Yahoo by us. Where authorized by us, Yahoo may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors. However, if you choose, you may opt out from Yahoo’s collection of such information outside of the Yahoo distribution network, by clicking on the following link: http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html.
                            <br/> <br/> We use a service by Adroll to offer targeted advertising to you. You may deactivate the Criteo Service by following following instructions in Adroll’s privacy policy: https://www.adrollgroup.com/privacy
                            <br/> The Site uses Facebook’s Custom Audiences feature to advertise on Facebook to previous visitors to our Site. This feature helps tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and display ads that are relevant to you. We create a Custom Audience on Facebook based on information you provide us, such as your name, email address and/or other contact information. In a process called “hashing,” the information provided by you is then summarized into a short “fingerprint” within a data file. This fingerprint is secure and cannot be decrypted. Facebook takes the data file of aggregated hashed fingerprints and electronically compares it to their existing hashed data to find a match. These matches become our Custom Audience. Facebook is not given the original information that you provided to us in order to create the fingerprint, so they do not have access to your personal information.
                            <br/> <br/> The Custom Audiences feature will only use this fingerprint for the matching process; it will not be shared with third parties or other advertisers and it will be deleted after the match process is complete. For your protection, Custom Audiences can only be targeted in ads once they have reached a critical mass (by aggregation of fingerprints) through which it is impossible to learn the individual identity of an any person visiting a website. Facebook will not: (a) give access to, or information about, Custom Audiences to third parties or other advertisers; (b) use Custom Audiences to append to the information we have about our users or build interest-based profiles; or (c) use Custom Audiences, except to provide services to you, unless you have given express permission for additional uses and/or disclosure of the information is otherwise required by law.
                            <br/> <br/> To find out if you’re seeing an ad because you’re included in a Custom Audience: (i) click the "X" or "down" icon near the top-right corner of any ad on Facebook; and (ii) select the “Why am I seeing this?” link or button and Facebook will explain whether you are part of a Custom Audience. If you are part of a Custom Audience and would like to opt-out, click the “opt-out” link after having selected the "Why am I seeing this?" option. You can also select "Hide all from this advertiser" to stop seeing any of our ads, both from Custom Audiences and other ways we may be showing you ads on Facebook.
                            <br/> <br/> Any PII collected by us will be used in accordance with our own Privacy Policy and Facebooks privacy policy.
                        </p>

                            <br/> <br/> To complete a merger or sale of assets. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, we may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.
                            <br/> <br/> We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest based advertising.
